     Apologies for the Cluttered Downloads section, I am to lazy to learn desktop github and console commands.

     You can use the command "scoreboard players set @p Logout 1" to trigger a message for the closest player,
     or "scoreboard players set @a[distance=..50] Logout 1" for an area of effect message.

     If your going to use this on a public or busy server I recommend editing some of the messages.

     To change the messages themselves, 
     navigate in the data/rmt/functions/join.mcfunction file and edit the text in between the brackets.
     Example:
     {"text":"Change this to your message","color":"gold"}
     
     There are notes in the datapack .mcf files on how to add more messages

     5 Commands, /trigger <motd-stopmusic-rfx-loginmusic-loginrfx>
     motd: sends the player a random message
     stopmusic: stops the music that plays.
     rfx: Turn on Infinte Effects for yourself.  (login effects must be on.)
     loginmusic: Toggle wether Music plays on login
     loginrfx: Toggle Whether Effects play at login.
     
     RFX and Music is no longer enabled by default, it has to be manually enabled by the player.
