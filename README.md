TRMotd (aka RMotd, Random Motd datapack)  

If your going to use this on a public or busy server I recommend using the PG edition. or edit some of the messages.   

     There are notes in the datapack .mcf files on how to add more messages  
     navigate in the data/rmt/functions/join.mcfunction file and edit the text in between the brackets.  
     Example:  
     {"text":"Change this to your message","color":"gold"}
