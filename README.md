   motd: sends the player a random message  
You can use the command:  
     /scoreboard players set @p Logout 1 ,to trigger a message for the closest player, or 
     /scoreboard players set @a[distance=..50] Logout 1 ,for an area of effect message.

If your going to use this on a public or busy server I recommend using the PG edition. or edit some of the messages.   
You can customize the messages once downloaded, there are notes in the function files explaing how to change or add messages.
