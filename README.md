Truly Random Message of the Day

A Datapack for Minecraft Java Edition

which sends a random message to the player when they log in.


Tested in 1.15, potentially compatible with 1.14.


If your going to use this on a public or busy server I recommend editing some of the messages,
To change the messages themselves, 
navigate in the data/rmt/functions/join.mcfunction file and edit the text in between the brackets.

Example:
{"text":"Change this to your message","color":"gold"}


There are notes in the datapack .mcf files on how to add more messages


I spent an inordinate amount of time making this so, I really hope your enjoy. :)
Special Thanks to M.R. Programs for helping me create this.
and to mcskware for his prng datapack for 1.13 and willingness to share his code.
