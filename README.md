If your going to use this on a public or busy server I recommend using the PG edition. or edit some of the messages.   

     Back-ports to older versions of minecraft coming soon.  The oldest versions of the pack were riddled with bugs and have been removed.
               (There will also be a depreceated pack of RFX soon if anyone wants the login music or visuals back.)
     You can customize the messages once downloaded, there are(will be) notes in the function files explaing how to change or add messages.
