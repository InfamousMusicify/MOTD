We're not done with the mash-up! (during the end credits)
''Amnesia? Forget that!''
''I am a single independent Catie and I don't need no man to eat me.''
''There were so many bananas.''
''Baka. I never said I liked you, Baka. Baka Aazzdos. Bakados.''
''My face actually does resemble a pair of buttocks.''
''It's like Zambies or some shit''
''Well you're in luck Aazz because I'm a big ol' boob'' Realms
''Pee is stored in the balls.'' - Rolmz the science guy.
''I mean, his face looks like an ass cause I want to BURY MY FACE IN IT.''
''If I could buy a car with ding dongs, I'd be walkin down the street, slappin my dick on every fuckin sportscar I saw!''
''Guess we gotta take off our pants!''
''I don't think I'm lewding him enough if he doesn't remember''
''Hail Satan.''
''I will do 100 dances for $1.''
''I jump like that... and then I die.'', Shovel Knight
''Why do you have to send me all the way back here?''
''You can enter both ways.''
''Realms come over and let's play with each other.''
''Wait ... are you a dominatrix Cherries?''
''I dunno if I need to have tantric sex with my wok or anything.''
''Grumbus, you're my only hope right now'' 'Celeste'
''All my life, all I've wanted to do was taste men!''
''Godammit Asch! I'm so sick of all this poop!''
''at least i dont smell like poo like realms does''
''Women will flock to your ass.''
''He's got all the fish in the sea, I am NOT fucking that thing.''
''I know where you are and I'll find you... and I'll craft you!''
''First I bang the drum, then I bang your mum.''
''I'm glad i'm a girl, cuz i'd have to see a doctor after every realms stream... for being hard for 4+ hours''
''Just press your bare ass up against the screen so I can just, caress it.''
''It was nice to meet you today. I think I have to go now. You’re a nice stripper. See you next time.''
''I'm easy''
''Is that like when you tell them to suck whip cream out of your ass but you have one stored in the chamber for them?''
''I FORGOT TO PEE ON THE BOSS!''
''Branbran uses raisin bran as an instrument to help him poop.''
''Realms, you can't just flamethrower anyone who doesn't want your meat inside them.''
''Can't doxx a PO box!''

''Oh boy, when both of those bois started targeted the booty, things started to get fruity.''
''Time for Realms to show off his wood to small children.''
''HE MADE ME COME''
The point of a DnD character is to make a CHARACTER to start with, not a build or an avatar for a game. Minmaxing should be like taking the minimum possible in stats you don't necessarily need, and the max in others.
''Do no harm, take no shit.''
''DEZZ DONT BE BITCHMADE''

''salt or sugar? probably sugar, it sounds less abrasive on my delicate derriere''
''You're PastaPlease! You don't let one bad experience ruin ... the whole ... bushel of ... potatoes.''
''Yes, go to sleep you little bitch.''
It's quiet now. Years have passed, and the songs has long since faded. All we are left with are a few lingering notes on the air. Are they really there? Or are they simply a trick of the mind trying to bring back what has passed. Maybe we will never know- oh wait, he's back. Never mind.

'' I love it. I love it so much!! They are drowning in snot!''
''What if cumming made noise, like buckshot from a shotgun''
''You can tell when Realms has been drinking because he gets even sweeter.''
''Imagine entering a dragon's lair, and instead of trying to eat you it turns around and just twerks its dummy thicc dragon ass in your face''
''Going ham on some regular ass pigeon.''

We are the masters of a power driven to the far reaches of the universe, and we have but one desire! Can one such as you possibly fathom how dearly we have clung to this dream across the aeons? How could you! You couldn't! Never ever ever! We who once faced those who were in such fear of our power that they sealed us away and banished us to the edge of the galaxy! US! As if THAT loveliness wasn't enough, they tried to erase our very existence from history! RUDE! Only through our magic were we able to overcome their science and achieve great prosperity! We alone were responsible for stopping that repulsive nightmare of a galactic crisis, yet this is how you repay us! This won't stand! It won't be forgiven! It won't be forgotten! Never ever EVER! Those who called us mad, are you listening? You left us at the edge of the galaxy to be forgotten, then went along your merry way, probably living somewhere pretty and peaceful! But know this! Your future is a farce! You have none! We, masters of a matter most dark, vow to be restored, as foretold in the book of legend, which everyone thought was just a fairy tale! It WASN'T! We have already obtained the vessel that contains our Dark Lord, and he will soon awaken and shower us in compassion! Look! The vessel of our Dark Lord is filling up even as we speak! Now the time for his greatness to enter our world has come! Welcome to a new history! A new age! The age of awesome! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DARK LORD! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Grace us, Gloriously Dark Looooooord!
