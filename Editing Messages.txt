     # Editing
If you want to Edit the content of the messages navigate to data/rmt/functions/join.mcfunction
To Edit the content of the New Player message navigate to data/rmt/functions/new.mcfunction

and edit the text between the curly brackets, Example:
{"text":"Change this to your message","color":"gold"}

# Keywords to search if you're purging the shameless self plugs for the famousbros server:
Death, Famous, FamousBros, Server.  (also edit the new.mcf in rmt to change the greeting message.)

     # Changing the Amount of Messages
If you want to increase or decrease the number of Messages there are 2 steps involved.
# Importatnt To Know, *Never edit the #randval in lod.mcf, it should always be at 0.
# Second, Maxrand should always be set 1 number above your last messages number, Example:
# Your last message = 130 than #maxrand = 131

     1a: Edit the join.Mcf File in the folder above, if you're removing messages your task is simple,
     delete from the bottom up the number of lines you wish to remove to get your desired number of messages.
     make sure you do not delete lines with lower numbers.
     1b: If you're adding messages its a little more time consuming but still relatively simple.
     head to the bottom of the Join.mcf from the file listed above, line 2001 is where you should add new messages, 
     move line 2002 down a bit so you dont break the anything when pasting. 
     
Line 2000 - tellraw @a[tag=RandMsg,scores={CurrentMsg=2000}] {"text":"144p GAMEPLAY!","color":"gold"}
Line 2001 - 
Line 2002 - tag @a remove RandMsg

     # Add messages by copy and pasting the command on line 2000 and editing the numbers to count up. 
     (change the mcprng #maxrand to your new last messages #+1 in mcprng:load.mcf.)
     
     2: Now head over to data/mcprng/functions/load.mcfunction, 
     and edit the number at the end of this command to you last message #+1
     ----- scoreboard players set #maxrand mcprng 2001 -----
     
Protip for editing vertical columns of text:  Notepad++, hold alt, click and drag your mouse down to select vertically.
